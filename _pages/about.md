I am a Ph.D. candidate in Finance at the University of North Texas working under the mentorship of [Prof. Dr. Stuart Gillan](https://cob.unt.edu/people/stuart-gillan.html). My research interests are in Corporate Finance, ESG, and Climate Finance, and I also enjoy using generative AI tools to support my research.
Teaching is one of the most meaningful parts of my academic life. For me, it’s not just about giving lectures-it is about making ideas feel real and helping students grow in confidence and understanding. I try to create a classroom where everyone feels welcome, questions are encouraged, and different perspectives are respected. One of the best parts of teaching is seeing students who start the course unsure of themselves finish with confidence. I listen to their concerns and show them that their success matters. To me, teaching is not just about sharing knowledge, but also about being kind, patient, and supportive. I want students to leave my class not just with new skills, but with a stronger sense of self-belief and curiosity that stays with them.
As much as I am interested in teaching, I am also deeply interested in research. My work focuses on corporate finance, ESG, and climate finance. I study how firms respond to policy and regulatory changes, and how markets value those responses. In one project, I examine how firms’ environmental performance affects stock prices during unexpected changes in U.S. climate policy, using the Inflation Reduction Act as a natural experiment. I am also studying how cross-country agreements shape market reactions to firms based on their carbon emissions and how well they manage them, especially across different institutional settings. I explore how corporate boards respond to legal and cybersecurity risks as well. For example, I built a new dataset on board and committee meeting frequencies using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that combines GPT-based APIs and text extraction tools. I enjoy using AI tools in my research to work with large amounts of text data in efficient and creative ways.
Outside academia, I enjoy traveling and trekking. One of my most memorable experiences was completing the Annapurna Circuit in Nepal, a multi-day high-altitude trek known for its stunning mountain views and cultural richness. 
I am currently on the job market. Feel free to reach out if I could be a good fit!
