## Job Market Paper

**Environmental Performance and Firm Value: Shock-based Evidence** (with Stuart Gillan and Nga Nguyen)<br>
*Abstract:* We study the relationship between environmental performance and firm value using
unexpected news about the inclusion of climate policies in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.
Stock market reactions for firms with “better” measures of aggregate climate performance are mixed
and tend to be more negative. However, analyses of sub-components of firms’ climate performance
show positive reactions for firms with greater opportunities in clean technology and renewable
energy, and preparedness for transitioning to a low-carbon economy. Analyses of industries with
high carbon emissions also show positive value effects for firms better prepared to transition to a
low carbon economy.

**Stock Price Effects of Cross-Country Climate Deals: Evidence from the Surprise US-China Climate Accord** (with Stuart Gillan and Nga Nguyen)<br>
*Abstract:* We study the surprise US-China climate deal on November 10, 2021, aimed at reducing
carbon emissions in both countries. Specifically, in an unexpected news announcement, United
States climate envoy John Kerry and his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua announced a bilateral
effort to curb carbon emissions. Paper focus on samples of both US and Chinese firms, provides insights into the potential for international political commitments aimed at limiting carbon emissions
to influence firms’ market value. We find that firms with high Carbon Emission Scores and Carbon
Emission Management Scores – reflecting proactive strategies and policies to manage and reduce
carbon emissions – experienced positive abnormal returns around the deal announcement, particularly US-based firms, suggesting that the market viewed the agreement as net benefit for these
US-based companies. Furthermore, firms with high Carbon Emission Management Score experienced significantly higher returns during the deal announcement, regardless of whether they had
high or low carbon emission intensity. This suggests that the market values effective management
of carbon emissions over the absolute level of emissions. However, there is no evidence of a value
effect for Chinese firms. These results underscore the varying impacts of carbon emission policies
on firm value and highlight the importance of focusing on not just an aggregate environmental or
carbon emissions score, but more refined measures of corporate environmental.
