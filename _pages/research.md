## Job Market Paper

**Environmental Performance and Firm Value: Shock-based Evidence** (with Stuart Gillan and Nga Nguyen)<br>
*Abstract:* We study the relationship between environmental performance and firm value using unexpected news about the inclusion of climate policies in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Stock market reactions for firms with “better” measures of aggregate climate performance are mixed and tend to be more negative. However, analyses of sub-components of firms’ climate performance show positive reactions for firms with greater opportunities in clean technology and renewable energy, and preparedness for transitioning to a low-carbon economy. Analyses of industries with high carbon emissions also show positive value effects for firms better prepared to transition to a low carbon economy.

**Stock Price Effects of Cross-Country Climate Deal: Evidence from the Surprise US-China Climate Accord** (with Stuart Gillan and Nga Nguyen)<br>
*Abstract:* We study the surprise US-China climate deal on November 10, 2021, aimed at reducing carbon emissions in both countries. Specifically, in an unexpected announcement byUnited States climate envoy John Kerry and his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua of a bilateral effort to curb carbon emissions. The paper examines samples of both US and Chinese firms and provides insights into how international political commitments aimed at limiting carbon emissions influence firms’ market values. We find that US firms with high MSCI Carbon Emission Scores and Carbon Emission Management Scores, reflecting proactive strategies and policies to manage and reduce carbon emissions, experienced positive abnormal returns around the deal announcement. Additional analysis shows that US firms with high Carbon Emission Management Scores experienced significantly higher returns around the deal announcement, regardless of whether they had high or low carbon emission intensity. This suggests that the market values effective management of carbon emissions over the absolute level of emissions. However, there is no evidence of value effects for Chinese firms. These results underscore the varying impacts of carbon emission policies on firm value and highlight the importance of focusing on not just an aggregate environmental or carbon emissions score, but more refined measures of corporate environmental performance.
