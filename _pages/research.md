## Job Market Paper

**Environmental Performance and Firm Value: Shock-based Evidence** (with Stuart Gillan and Nga Nguyen)<br>
*Abstract:* We study the relationship between environmental performance and firm value using
unexpected news about the inclusion of climate policies in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.
Stock market reactions for firms with “better” measures of aggregate climate performance are mixed
and tend to be more negative. However, analyses of sub-components of firms’ climate performance
show positive reactions for firms with greater opportunities in clean technology and renewable
energy, and preparedness for transitioning to a low-carbon economy. Analyses of industries with
high carbon emissions also show positive value effects for firms better prepared to transition to a
low carbon economy.

**Stock Price Effects of Cross-Country Climate Deals: Evidence from the Surprise US-China Climate Accord** (with Stuart Gillan and Nga Nguyen)<br>
*Abstract:* This paper explores the surprise US-China climate deal on November 10, 2021, aimed
at reducing carbon emissions in both countries. It focuses on how this bilateral effort to curb
carbon emissions influences investor behavior and the market values of companies, particularly
those with varying levels of carbon emissions and carbon emission management practices. We
find that firms with high Carbon Emission Scores and Carbon Emission Management Scores are
associated with positive abnormal returns around the deal announcement, particularly in the United
States, indicating a market preference for proactive carbon management. Additionally, firms with
low Emissions Intensity and high Carbon Management Scores had significantly higher returns,
suggesting that the market values management practices. These results underscore the varying
impacts of carbon emission policies on firm value and highlight the importance of focusing on the
details of firm climate policies.
